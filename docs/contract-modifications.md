# Contract modifications

The contract extension limits modifications that can be made to contracts to
those and provides a UI and API to facilitate these modifications.

It keeps a history of significant changes (or modifications) made to contracts
and allows for modifications to be scheduled into the future.

The extension specifies 6 different types of modification:

*   *Sign* - when a contract is created
*   *Update* - when significant updates (as defined by the contract extension) are
    made to a contract
*   *Pause* - when a contract status changes from current to paused
*   *Resume* - when a contract status changes from paused to current.
*   *Cancel* - when a contract status changes from current to cancelled
*   *Revive* - when a contract status changes from cancelled to current. This
    change may be accompanied by the same significant updates that are defined
    in the update modification

The extension replaces the default create membership form with a Create contract
form.

It provides additional *Update*, *Pause*, *Cancel* and *Revive* forms to that
can be used to modify contracts.

The edit membership form is left in place though extra validation occurs on this
form to ensure that modifications made using this form fit the contract model.

## Significant changes

Significant changes are those in which one of the following contract fields is
updated

*   status
*   membership type
*   recurring membership payment


### Changes to the recurring membership payment

Changes to how a membership is being paid for might depend on the current and
the future payment instrument. The extension comes with a set of available
payment options (those might be configurable in future releases):

* Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT)
* Cash
* SEPA Direct Debit (using [*CiviSEPA*](https://github.com/project60/org.project60.sepa))
* No payment (for free memberships)

Especially with the *CiviSEPA* implementation for direct debit mandates, for
legal reasons updating involves cancelling an existing mandate and creating a
new one if relevant information changes. A SEPA mandate is only valid for a
specific debitor, a specific amount and installment cycle, so changes to those
properties will have to result in a new SEPA mandate being created.

Also, when changing the payment method from e.g. SEPA Direct Debit to EFT, the
mandate needs to be ended accordingly, because CiviSEPA would otherwise continue
to collect installments from the debitor, while legally the mandate is no longer
valid.


## Modifying contracts with the API

The `contract.modify` is designed for contract modifications. These
modifications can happen immediately or be scheduled into the future.

The `contract.modify` API is a wrapper around the `activity.create` API. It
creates scheduled contract modification activities which, depending on the
activity date will either be executed now or in the future.

`Contract.modify` takes the following parameters (* = required).

*   `id`* (of the contract)
*   `action`* - the type of action
*   `date` - when you want the action to be carried out
*   `note` - to store notes about the update
*   `medium_id` - the contact medium for this update

Then depending on what action you are calling, you can pass other parameters.

If you are calling update or revive, you can pass

*   `membership_type_id`
*   `membership_payment.membership_recurring_contribution`
*   `campaign_id`
*   `membership_payment.membership_recurring_contribution`
*   `membership_cancellation.membership_cancel_reason`
*   `membership_payment.membership_annual`
*   `membership_payment.membership_frequency`
*   `membership_payment.cycle_day`
*   `membership_payment.to_ba`

If you are calling cancel, you must pass
*   `membership_cancellation.membership_cancel_reason` (a cancel reason)

If you are calling pause, you must pass

*   `resume_data` - this will schedule a contract resume activity for that date.

A note on passing dates to the contract API

*   a call to `contract modify` without a date is processed immediately
*   a call to `contract.modify` with a date in the future will be scheduled
*   a call to `contract.modify` with a date in the past will raise an exception

## Modifying a contract directly

Contracts can also be modified by updating the contract directly (for example,
via the Contract API or via the contract edit form). When an attempt is made to
modify a contract directly, the contract extension checks to ensure that the
modification is allowed by the contract extension. If it is valid, the update is
made and a *completed* contract modification activity is recorded for the
contract.

Note that if a contract is updated and no significant changes are made, then no
contract modification activity will be recorded.

## Multiple scheduled modifications

Whenever a scheduled modification is created or edited, we check to see how many
scheduled modifications are present.

If there is more than one scheduled modification, we set the status of each
activity to needs review.

If a user attempts to modify (or schedule a modification) to a contract via the
UI, and one or more modifications are already scheduled, a warning message will
appear alerting the user that there are modifications are already scheduled.

If multiple modifications have been created and a user has not had the chance to
acknowledge the warning (for example if it is been created via the API), then
contract will be marked for review (how we implement the mark this is TBC -
could be either with a scheduled review contract modifications activity or with
a tag).

## Failed modifications

Note that one cannot create a failed modification via the UI as it will be
caught by the form validation.

One can schedule multiple modifications. one of which may fail.

In the event that a scheduled contract update fails (i.e. it does not pass
validation) we set the activity status to 'Failed' and alert the user (how?)

## Implementation notes

There are two pathways for updating contracts.
1.  modifying contracts based on information in scheduled contract activities
2.  "listening" for updates on the contract entity recording activities after
    the update has been carried out that record what the update was.

We need to allow pathway 1 to ignore and not listen any contract updates that
originate via pathway 2. If we don't then pathway 1 will create duplicate
contract modification activities when pathway 2 updates the contract.

We do this by passing a setting create_modification_activity to false in the
contract API.

## Processing scheduled contract updates

A `Job.process_contract_updates` process all scheduled updates.
